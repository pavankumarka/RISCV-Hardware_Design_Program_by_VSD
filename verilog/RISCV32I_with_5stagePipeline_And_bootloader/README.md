Creating a simple RISC-V 32-bit processor with a 5-stage pipeline and a testbench for a bootloader in Verilog involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of the process, followed by the Verilog code for a basic RISC-V 32-bit 5-stage pipeline processor and a simple testbench.
Key Components of the Pipeline:

    IF (Instruction Fetch) - Fetch the instruction from memory.

    ID (Instruction Decode) - Decode the instruction, read registers.

    EX (Execute) - Perform ALU operations.

    MEM (Memory Access) - Read/write data from/to memory.

    WB (Write Back) - Write results back to the register file.
