Creating a simple RISC-V 32-bit processor with a 5-stage pipeline and a testbench for a bootloader in Verilog involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of the process, followed by the Verilog code for a basic RISC-V 32-bit 5-stage pipeline processor and a simple testbench.


To build an RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit Integer) CPU with a 5-stage pipeline in Verilog, you need to implement the following core building blocks, each corresponding to one pipeline stage or essential infrastructure around it:

🚀 5-Stage Pipeline Overview
        Stage	Name	Purpose
        IF	Instruction Fetch	Fetch instruction from memory
        ID	Instruction Decode	Decode instruction and read registers
        EX	Execute	Perform ALU operations, branch calculations
        MEM	Memory Access	Read/write data memory
        WB	Write Back	Write results back to register file
🧱 Essential Building Blocks

1. 🔧 Program Counter (PC)

    Holds the address of the current instruction.

    Increments by 4 every cycle unless a branch or jump occurs.

reg [31:0] pc;


2. 📦 Instruction Memory (IMEM)

    Read-only memory storing machine instructions.

    Typically synchronous ROM or inferred from a memory array.

reg [31:0] instr_mem [0:1023];


3. 🧠 Control Unit

    Generates control signals based on the opcode (from the instruction).

    Controls ALU operation, memory read/write, register write, etc.

Outputs:

    RegWrite, MemRead, MemWrite, ALUSrc, Branch, ALUOp


4. 📗 Register File

    32 registers (x0 to x31)

    2 read ports, 1 write port

reg [31:0] registers[0:31];


5. 🧮 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

    Performs operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT

    Controlled by ALUControl signal (from ALU decoder)

Inputs: src1, src2, ALUControl
Output: result, zero

6. 🧪 ALU Control

    Maps high-level ALUOp + funct3/funct7 to a specific ALU operation.

7. 🧱 Immediate Generator

    Extracts and sign-extends immediate values based on instruction format (I-type, S-type, B-type, etc.)


8. 💾 Data Memory (DMEM)

    For load and store instructions (lw, sw, ld, sd)

    Accessed in the MEM stage

9. 🔁 Forwarding Unit

    Resolves data hazards by forwarding results from later pipeline stages to earlier ones (e.g., EX to ID)

10. 🛑 Hazard Detection Unit

    Detects hazards (especially load-use hazards) and issues pipeline stalls or nops

11. 📤 Pipeline Registers

These are flip-flops between pipeline stages to hold data and control signals.
        Register	Between Stages
        IF/ID	IF → ID
        ID/EX	ID → EX
        EX/MEM	EX → MEM
        MEM/WB	MEM → WB

12. 📐 Branch Unit

    Calculates branch target address

    Decides whether to flush or continue pipeline

    Branch decision based on flags like zero from ALU


13. 🔄 Multiplexers

    Select between:

        Register value vs. immediate (ALUSrc)

        ALU result vs. memory data (MemtoReg)

        PC+4 vs. branch/jump address

🧩 Optional/Advanced Additions
        Feature	Purpose
        CSR Registers	Control and status registers
        Exception Handling	Trap instructions, misaligned PC
        Multicycle Divider	For div, rem (RV32IM)
        Pipeline Flushing	On branches or mispredicts
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Stage 2: Instruction Decode (ID)

📦 Responsibilities:

    Decode the fetched instruction.

    Read registers rs1 and rs2.

    Generate control signals.

    Extract and sign-extend the immediate value.

    Pass all this to the next pipeline stage (ID/EX).

Stage 3: Execute (EX)
    
    Includes:

    ALU

    ALU Control

    Pass to MEM/WB register

📦 Responsibilities:

    Perform load (lw) and store (sw) operations.

    Use the address computed by ALU to access Data Memory.

    Control memory read/write based on instruction type.

    Pass results to MEM/WB pipeline register.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Next stage is:
    
    Stage 5: Writeback (WB)

    Write result from ALU or Memory back to the register file.

📦 Responsibilities:

    Select either:

        ALU result (for instructions like add, sub, etc.), or

        Data Memory output (for lw)

    Write the selected result to the destination register in the register file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 6: Pipeline Integration Plan

📌 Key Components:

    Pipeline Registers: Hold stage outputs between cycles

        IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB

    Hazard Detection Unit (for load-use hazards)

    Forwarding Unit (to resolve data hazards)

    Stall & Flush Logic (for control hazards/branches)

    Top Module (riscv_pipelined_cpu.v)

    Testbench (tb_riscv_pipelined_cpu.v)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 6.1: IF/ID Pipeline Register
📦 Purpose:

    Store instruction and PC from Instruction Fetch (IF) stage.

    Feed them into the Instruction Decode (ID) stage in the next cycle.

Signal	Description

pc_in	Program Counter from IF stage

instr_in	Instruction fetched from memory

flush	Clears the register (on branch mispredict)

stall	Prevents update (on data hazard)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 6.2: ID/EX Pipeline Register

Holds all necessary data decoded from the instruction in the ID stage and passes it to the EX stage:

    Register values (rs1_val, rs2_val)

    Immediate value

    Register addresses


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 6.3: EX/MEM Pipeline Register
📦 Purpose:

    ALU result

    Second register value (for store instructions)

    Destination register

    Control signals needed in the MEM and WB stages

📌 Key Outputs:

🔜 What’s Next?

Would you like to proceed with:

    🚦 Forwarding Unit (for data hazards), or

    🧠 Hazard Detection Unit, or

    🔗 Top-level integration of all stages into riscv_pipelined_cpu.v?

✅ Step 7.1: Forwarding Unit

📦 Purpose:

The Forwarding Unit detects RAW (Read After Write) hazards and forwards data from the EX/MEM or MEM/WB stages back to the ALU inputs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 7.2: Hazard Detection Unit

📦 Purpose:

Detects hazards caused by instructions like lw when the next instruction tries to use the loaded value before it’s ready (i.e., load-use hazard).
The HDU stalls the pipeline to avoid incorrect execution.

📌 Outputs:

Signal	Meaning

pc_write	0 to stall the PC update

if_id_write	0 to stall the IF/ID register

control_stall	1 to insert a NOP (disable controls)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 7.3: Control Unit with Stall Support

📦 Purpose:

Generates control signals based on the current opcode in the Decode (ID) stage. If a hazard is detected (control_stall = 1), the control signals are nulled (NOP inserted).

📌 Output Signals:

Signal	Description

reg_write	Write back to register file

mem_to_reg	Selects between ALU result or memory for WB

mem_read	Enables memory read

mem_write	Enables memory write

alu_op	Passed to ALU control to choose operation

alu_src	Selects 2nd ALU operand (reg or imm)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Step 8: Top-Level Pipelined CPU (Minimal Integration Version)

📦 Module: riscv_pipelined_cpu.v

To keep this clean and manageable, we'll start with a skeleton that integrates the major components and you can expand as needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧪 Step 9: Create a Testbench (tb_riscv_pipelined_cpu.v)

This testbench will:

    Instantiate the top-level CPU module.

    Drive a clock signal.

    Observe outputs like register values, program counter, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Step 10: Simple RISC-V Program → Machine Code → Instruction Memory
🔧 RISC-V Assembly Code Example (RV32I)

We’ll write a simple program:

addi x1, x0, 5       # x1 = 5
addi x2, x0, 3       # x2 = 3
add  x3, x1, x2      # x3 = x1 + x2 = 8
sw   x3, 0(x0)       # Store x3 at memory address 0

🔁 Convert Assembly to Machine Code

We'll use the RV32I encoding format:
        Instruction	Opcode	Binary Encoding
        addi x1, x0, 5	0x00500093	000000000101 00000 000 00001 0010011
        addi x2, x0, 3	0x00300113	000000000011 00000 000 00010 0010011
        add x3, x1, x2	0x002081B3	0000000 00010 00001 000 00011 0110011
        sw x3, 0(x0)	0x00302023	0000000 00011 00000 010 00000 0100011
