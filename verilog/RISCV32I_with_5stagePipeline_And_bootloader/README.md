Creating a simple RISC-V 32-bit processor with a 5-stage pipeline and a testbench for a bootloader in Verilog involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of the process, followed by the Verilog code for a basic RISC-V 32-bit 5-stage pipeline processor and a simple testbench.
Key Components of the Pipeline:

    IF (Instruction Fetch) - Fetch the instruction from memory.

    ID (Instruction Decode) - Decode the instruction, read registers.

    EX (Execute) - Perform ALU operations.

    MEM (Memory Access) - Read/write data from/to memory.

    WB (Write Back) - Write results back to the register file.

Explanation of Key Components:

    ALU: The ALU performs simple operations like addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations. You can extend this for more operations if needed.

    Pipeline Registers: These store data between the pipeline stages.

    Program Counter (PC): Keeps track of the address of the instruction being executed. The instruction fetch stage increments the PC every clock cycle.

    Memory: The code assumes that memory is hardcoded or simulated. In a real-world scenario, memory would be external and initialized with a bootloader or small program.

Bootloader Simulation:

The testbench initializes the processor and runs the pipeline for a fixed amount of time. You can extend this by loading actual machine code into the memory and verifying if the processor correctly fetches and executes the instructions.
Next Steps:

    Extend ALU: Add more ALU operations (multiplication, division, etc.).

    Interrupt Handling: Add interrupt logic if needed.

    Memory Management: Implement more complex memory management, like cache, to make the bootloader more realistic.

    Bootloader Code: Write a simple bootloader in assembly to load into the processorâ€™s memory to simulate a full boot-up sequence.
