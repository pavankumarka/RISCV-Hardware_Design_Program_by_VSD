Creating a simple RISC-V 32-bit processor with a 5-stage pipeline and a testbench for a bootloader in Verilog involves several steps. Below is a high-level overview of the process, followed by the Verilog code for a basic RISC-V 32-bit 5-stage pipeline processor and a simple testbench.


To build an RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit Integer) CPU with a 5-stage pipeline in Verilog, you need to implement the following core building blocks, each corresponding to one pipeline stage or essential infrastructure around it:

🚀 5-Stage Pipeline Overview
        Stage	Name	Purpose
        IF	Instruction Fetch	Fetch instruction from memory
        ID	Instruction Decode	Decode instruction and read registers
        EX	Execute	Perform ALU operations, branch calculations
        MEM	Memory Access	Read/write data memory
        WB	Write Back	Write results back to register file
🧱 Essential Building Blocks

1. 🔧 Program Counter (PC)

    Holds the address of the current instruction.

    Increments by 4 every cycle unless a branch or jump occurs.

reg [31:0] pc;


2. 📦 Instruction Memory (IMEM)

    Read-only memory storing machine instructions.

    Typically synchronous ROM or inferred from a memory array.

reg [31:0] instr_mem [0:1023];


3. 🧠 Control Unit

    Generates control signals based on the opcode (from the instruction).

    Controls ALU operation, memory read/write, register write, etc.

Outputs:

    RegWrite, MemRead, MemWrite, ALUSrc, Branch, ALUOp


4. 📗 Register File

    32 registers (x0 to x31)

    2 read ports, 1 write port

reg [31:0] registers[0:31];


5. 🧮 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

    Performs operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT

    Controlled by ALUControl signal (from ALU decoder)

Inputs: src1, src2, ALUControl
Output: result, zero

6. 🧪 ALU Control

    Maps high-level ALUOp + funct3/funct7 to a specific ALU operation.

7. 🧱 Immediate Generator

    Extracts and sign-extends immediate values based on instruction format (I-type, S-type, B-type, etc.)


8. 💾 Data Memory (DMEM)

    For load and store instructions (lw, sw, ld, sd)

    Accessed in the MEM stage

9. 🔁 Forwarding Unit

    Resolves data hazards by forwarding results from later pipeline stages to earlier ones (e.g., EX to ID)

10. 🛑 Hazard Detection Unit

    Detects hazards (especially load-use hazards) and issues pipeline stalls or nops

11. 📤 Pipeline Registers

These are flip-flops between pipeline stages to hold data and control signals.
        Register	Between Stages
        IF/ID	IF → ID
        ID/EX	ID → EX
        EX/MEM	EX → MEM
        MEM/WB	MEM → WB

12. 📐 Branch Unit

    Calculates branch target address

    Decides whether to flush or continue pipeline

    Branch decision based on flags like zero from ALU


13. 🔄 Multiplexers

    Select between:

        Register value vs. immediate (ALUSrc)

        ALU result vs. memory data (MemtoReg)

        PC+4 vs. branch/jump address

🧩 Optional/Advanced Additions
        Feature	Purpose
        CSR Registers	Control and status registers
        Exception Handling	Trap instructions, misaligned PC
        Multicycle Divider	For div, rem (RV32IM)
        Pipeline Flushing	On branches or mispredicts

✅ Stage 2: Instruction Decode (ID)

📦 Responsibilities:

    Decode the fetched instruction.

    Read registers rs1 and rs2.

    Generate control signals.

    Extract and sign-extend the immediate value.

    Pass all this to the next pipeline stage (ID/EX).
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Stage 3: Execute (EX)
    
    Includes:

    ALU

    ALU Control

    Branch calculation logic

    ID/EX → EX/MEM pipeline register

✅ Stage 3: Execute (EX)
📦 Responsibilities:

    Perform ALU operations (add, sub, and, or, etc.).

    Compute branch target address.

    Select ALU inputs (register or immediate).

    Determine the ALU operation from instruction and control signals.

    Pass results to EX/MEM pipeline register.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Next stage is:

    Stage 4: Memory Access (MEM)

    Load and store operations

    Access data memory

    Pass to MEM/WB register

📦 Responsibilities:

    Perform load (lw) and store (sw) operations.

    Use the address computed by ALU to access Data Memory.

    Control memory read/write based on instruction type.

    Pass results to MEM/WB pipeline register.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Next stage is:
    
    Stage 5: Writeback (WB)

    Write result from ALU or Memory back to the register file.

📦 Responsibilities:

    Select either:

        ALU result (for instructions like add, sub, etc.), or

        Data Memory output (for lw)

    Write the selected result to the destination register in the register file
