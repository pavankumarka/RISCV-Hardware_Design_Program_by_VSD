Overall Flow: ML-Enhanced Clock Skew Analysis

Simulate Skew using Verilog (as you've done).

Extract Features from waveforms or simulation logs.

Train ML Model to predict:

Whether skew will cause setup/hold violations.

Optimal delay to apply to resolve skew.

Apply Prediction to guide RTL parameterization or delay insertion.

ðŸ”¬ Step-by-Step Breakdown
âœ… 1. Generate Simulation Data

    Simulate the Verilog design with different skew values and log the outcome (e.g., setup/hold pass/fail, output mismatch).

âœ… 2. Extract Features for ML
    From each simulation, extract:
    
    Clock period
    
    Skew value
    
    Flip-flop setup/hold times
    
    Whether timing was met
    
    Output mismatch status
    
    You might collect this into a CSV file like:
    
    clock_period,skew_ns,setup_time,hold_time,output_match,timing_pass
    10,3,2,1,0,0
    10,1,2,1,1,1

âœ… 3. Train a Model (Python + scikit-learn example)
      python
      
      import pandas as pd
      from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
      from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
      
      # Load simulation data
      df = pd.read_csv("skew_sim_data.csv")
      
      # Define features and target
      X = df[["clock_period", "skew_ns", "setup_time", "hold_time"]]
      y = df["timing_pass"]
      
      # Train/test split
      X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
      
      # Train model
      model = RandomForestClassifier()
      model.fit(X_train, y_train)
      
      # Evaluate
      accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
      print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

âœ… 4. Predict Optimal Skew

    Once trained, the model can predict whether a proposed skew setting will cause a violation. 
    You can integrate this into your RTL verification workflow to auto-adjust delay lines or alert designers.

ðŸ§  Advanced Possibilities
    Reinforcement Learning: To learn optimal clock delay adjustments over time.
    
    Bayesian Optimization: For finding minimum skew that maintains setup/hold margins.
    
    Neural Nets: For predicting skew-induced behavior in larger systems with many flip-flops.
