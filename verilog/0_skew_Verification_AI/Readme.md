What is Clock Skew?

    Clock skew is the difference in arrival time of a clock signal at different parts of a circuit.

    It can be intentional (for timing optimization) or unintentional (due to routing delays).

    Resolution techniques include using clock buffers, clock trees, or timing constraints during synthesis/PnR.
