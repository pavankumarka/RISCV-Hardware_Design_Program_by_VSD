What is Clock Skew?

    Clock skew is the difference in arrival time of a clock signal at different parts of a circuit.

    It can be intentional (for timing optimization) or unintentional (due to routing delays).

    Resolution techniques include using clock buffers, clock trees, or timing constraints during synthesis/PnR.

Clock skew is a timing issue that arises in synchronous circuits when a clock signal arrives at different components at slightly different times. Verilog doesnâ€™t inherently model clock skew unless delays are introduced manually. To simulate clock skew and demonstrate skew resolution techniques (like using clock delay or phase alignment), you can model a testbench and a simple sequential design.

Here's a complete example to introduce skew and demonstrate how to resolve it in Verilog:
