# vsd_riscV_product_design
Overview: The "RISC-V Hardware Design Program" or "Product Based RISC-V Skilling Program" is a Six weeks of practical/lab oriented workshop course, for Hardware-Software Co-simulation focused product design enthusiast's, taught by VSD Team.

Instructors:
1. Mayank Kabra
2. Kunal Ghosh

Summary: Design and build Application software which can be compiled for RISC-V hardware architecture.
1. Design and build software Application targetting end hardware.
2. Convert application Design Input/output with software and Hardware co-simulation minset.
3. Convert App design to State Machine.
4. Write C-Program (or any High-level language) for the application (Embedded app).
5. Verify C-code using compiler for RISC-V using Godbolt.org online compiler.
   Gotbolt also supports other CPU architectures and compilers.
7. Dump the compiled code into RISC-V for pre-silicon verification on ChipCron tool. 
8. Define GPIO registers.
9. Convert C to verilog for Device Uner Test (DUT)- plan HDL design and verification.
10. Write test bench for DUT via simulation.
11. RTL design covers Pre-synthesis (Skywaters by google) and Post-Synthesis.
