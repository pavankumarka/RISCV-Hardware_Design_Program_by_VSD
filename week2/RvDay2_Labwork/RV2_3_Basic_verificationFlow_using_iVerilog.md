VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS COURSE:

Basic Verification Flow using iVerilog.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Let us say we have a Verilog written RTL.
2. Also let us say we have a C-program written and converted into Hex file.
3. Next our requirment is to explore how we load the C-program compiled Hex file, and load it into RTL of RISC-V CPU and obtain the result.
