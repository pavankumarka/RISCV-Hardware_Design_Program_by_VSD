Week1 Agenda:


Resources Links:

    1. Link for godbolt compiler: https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer
    
    2. Link for iverilog and GTKWave basics: https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ai4WW_jutengiLoCGM2HRRUOXJnNzQ?e=6j1qcW 


Week1 Assignments:

Task1:
    Assignment: Share Assembly Language observations for AVR, x86 and RISC-V processors using godbolt compiler for following modules,
    
    1. 4bit counter.
        Assignment to cover: Check ALP differences for 4 and 5bits counter for 3 different processors.
    
    2. matrix multiplication.

Solutions:

Task2:
    Assignments: 

    1. Calculate 1's and 2's compliment using signed number representation for these, A. 10-19        B. 20+30        C. 36+12

    2. Design ALU in C-code and verify using gcc compiler and notedown the observations wrt gotbold comipler.

    3. Design the same ALU code in verilog and verify it using iVerilog and gtkwave.

    Design Requirments:
    Select lines to select mathematical operations.
