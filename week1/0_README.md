Week1 Assignments:

Task1:
    Assignment: Share Assembly Language observations for AVR, x86 and RISC-V processors using godbolt compiler for following modules,
    
    1. 4bit counter.
        Assignment to cover: Check ALP differences for 4 and 5bits counter for 3 different processors.

    Solution: https://github.com/pavankumarka/RISCV-Hardware_Design_Program_by_VSD/blob/main/week1/2_1s_2s_Compliments/README.md

    2. Design ALU in C-code and verify using gcc compiler and notedown the observations wrt gotbold comipler.

    Solution: 

    3. Design the same ALU code in verilog and verify it using iVerilog and gtkwave.

    Design Requirments:
    Select lines to select mathematical operations.
