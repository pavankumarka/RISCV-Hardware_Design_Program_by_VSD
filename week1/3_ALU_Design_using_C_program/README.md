**ALU**

A Simple ALU design is described and implemented here

Refer PICTURE 1 to 3 below for Design Requirement and the output screenshots which are self explainatory.

C-program for ALU design requirement is captured in alu.c file 

    1. alu.s is the assembly code for alu.c c-program, that is compiled in local Linux computer  

    2. gotbold_alu_gcc.s is the assembly code for alu, compiled using GOTBOLT COMPILER by selecting x86_64 gcc 13.2.
