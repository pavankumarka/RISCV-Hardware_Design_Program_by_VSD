# RISCV ISA Introduction:

The RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") instruction set architecture (ISA) is an open-source, modular, and extensible ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) designed for a 
wide range of computing applications, from embedded systems to supercomputers. It was developed at the University of California, Berkeley, and is now maintained by 
the RISC-V International organization.

RISC-V is based on the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) principles, which emphasize simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. 
Below is an overview of the RISC-V instruction set:

# Key Features of RISC-V

1. Open Standard:

RISC-V is freely available under an open-source license, allowing anyone to use, modify, and implement it without royalties or restrictions.

2. Modular Design:

The ISA is divided into a base integer instruction set and optional extensions. This allows designers to customize the ISA for specific applications.

3. 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit Support:

RISC-V supports different address space sizes:

RV32: 32-bit address space.

RV64: 64-bit address space.

RV128: 128-bit address space (mostly theoretical at this point).

4. Load-Store Architecture:

Like other RISC architectures, RISC-V uses a load-store model, where only load and store instructions access memory, and arithmetic/logic operations operate on registers.

5. Fixed-Length Instructions:

Most instructions are 32 bits wide, but there is also a compressed instruction set (RVC) with 16-bit instructions for improved code density.

6. Extensible:

Users can add custom instructions for specific applications, making RISC-V highly adaptable.

7. Base Instruction Sets

RISC-V defines several base instruction sets, depending on the address space size:

7.1 RV32I:

32-bit base integer instruction set.

Includes 32 general-purpose registers (x0â€“x31), where x0 is hardwired to zero.

Supports basic arithmetic, logical, control flow, and memory access instructions.

7.2 RV64I:

64-bit base integer instruction set.

Extends RV32I to support 64-bit operations.

7.3 RV128I:

128-bit base integer instruction set (mostly theoretical and not widely implemented).

# Optional Extensions

RISC-V allows for optional extensions to add functionality. Some common extensions include:

1 M (Integer Multiplication and Division):

Adds instructions for multiplication (MUL, MULH) and division (DIV, REM).

2 A (Atomic Operations):

Adds atomic memory operations for synchronization (e.g., LR for load-reserved and SC for store-conditional).

3 F (Single-Precision Floating-Point):

Adds 32-bit floating-point instructions.

4 D (Double-Precision Floating-Point):

Adds 64-bit floating-point instructions.

5 C (Compressed Instructions):

Adds 16-bit compressed instructions to improve code density.

6 B (Bit Manipulation):

Adds instructions for bit-level operations (e.g., bitwise rotations, counting leading/trailing zeros).

7 V (Vector Operations):

Adds SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for vector processing.

8 Zicsr (Control and Status Register Access):

Adds instructions to access control and status registers (CSRs).

9. P (Packed-SIMD):

Similar to vector extensions but with specific features for packed SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.

10. L (RISC-V Large Memory Model):

An extension for processors that need to work with large memory models (used in RV128).

# Example Configurations

Here are some of the common combinations of these extensions:

    RV32I:        Supports basic arithmetic, logical, control flow, and memory access instructions
    RV32IM:       32-bit base with multiplication and division instructions.
    RV32IMAC:    32-bit base with multiplication, division, atomic, and compressed instructions.
    RV64IMAFDC:  64-bit base with multiplication, division, atomic, floating-point (single and double precision), and compressed instructions.
    RV64G:       64-bit base with the "G" set, which includes:
        I (Base integer)
        M (Multiplication and Division)
        A (Atomic operations)
        F (Single-precision floating-point)
        D (Double-precision floating-point)
        C (Compressed instructions)
    RV128IMAFDC:  128-bit base with the most common extensions, including integer operations, multiplication, division, atomic, floating-point, and compressed instructions.


# Instruction Formats

RISC-V instructions are encoded in a fixed 32-bit format, with six main formats:

1. R-Type (Register):

Used for register-to-register operations.

Fields: opcode, rd, funct3, rs1, rs2, funct7.

2. I-Type (Immediate):

Used for immediate arithmetic, loads, and jumps.

Fields: opcode, rd, funct3, rs1, imm[11:0].

3. S-Type (Store):

Used for store instructions.

Fields: opcode, imm[4:0], funct3, rs1, rs2, imm[11:5].

4. B-Type (Branch):

Used for conditional branches.

Fields: opcode, imm[11], imm[4:1], funct3, rs1, rs2, imm[10:5], imm[12].

5. U-Type (Upper Immediate):

Used for loading large immediate values.

Fields: opcode, rd, imm[31:12].

6. J-Type (Jump):

Used for unconditional jumps.

Fields: opcode, rd, imm[19:12], imm[11], imm[10:1], imm[20].

# Example Instructions

Here are some common RISC-V instructions:

1. Arithmetic:

ADD x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 + x3)

SUB x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 - x3)

MUL x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 * x3, requires M extension)

2. Logical:

AND x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 & x3)

OR x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 | x3)

XOR x1, x2, x3 (x1 = x2 ^ x3)

3. Memory Access:

LW x1, offset(x2) (Load word from memory at address x2 + offset into x1)

SW x1, offset(x2) (Store word from x1 into memory at address x2 + offset)

4. Control Flow:

BEQ x1, x2, label (Branch to label if x1 == x2)

JAL x1, label (Jump to label and save return address in x1)

5. Floating-Point:

FADD.S f1, f2, f3 (f1 = f2 + f3, requires F extension)

FMUL.D f1, f2, f3 (f1 = f2 * f3, requires D extension)

# Applications of RISC-V
