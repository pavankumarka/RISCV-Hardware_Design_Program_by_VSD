**RISC-V Hardware Design Program by VSD**

**Program Overview:** The "RISC-V Hardware Design Program" or "Product Based RISC-V Skilling Program" is a Six weeks of practical/lab 
oriented workshop course, for Hardware-Software Co-simulation focused product design enthusiast's, taught by VSD Team.


**Instructors:**

1. Mayank Kabra
2. Kunal Ghosh




**Opensource Tools:** (Preinstalled VDI image provided by VSD team has following tools)

1. gcc compiler.
2. iVerilog.
3. gtkwave.
4. SPICE Framework.
5. RISC-V Compiler.
6. list to grow further...
   

**Steps followed:**
1. Design and build software Application targetting end hardware architecture.
2. Convert application Design Input/output with software and Hardware co-simulation mindset.
3. Convert App design to State Machine.
4. Write C-Program (or any High-level language) for the application (Embedded app).
5. Verify C-code using compiler for RISC-V using Godbolt.org online compiler.
6. Dump the compiled code into RISC-V for pre-silicon verification on ChipCron tool.
7. Define GPIO registers.
8. Convert C to verilog for Device Uner Test (DUT)- plan HDL design and verification.
9. Write test bench for DUT via simulation.
10. RTL design covers Pre-synthesis (Skywaters by google) and Post-Synthesis.
